# Identity Management System Based on Blockchain Technology


Identity is an integral part of a functioning society and economy. Having a proper way to identify ourselves and our possessions enables us to create thriving societies and global markets. 
At its most basic level, identity is a collection of claims about a person, place, or thing. For people, this usually consists of first and last name, date of birth, nationality, and some form of a national identifier such as passport number, social security number (SSN), driving license, etc. These data points are issued by centralized entities (governments) and are stored in centralized databases (central government servers). 
Existing identity management systems are neither secure nor reliable, In this study, we will propose a blockchain-based solution for identity management, to provide more privacy, security, and control over our identity documents.
